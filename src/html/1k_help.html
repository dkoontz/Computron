The Computron is made up of several locations, each of which can hold a single integer value.  There are 4 general purpose locations (<b>triangle</b>, <b>square</b>, <b>hexagon</b>, <b>star</b>) and 4 special purpose locations (<b>input_a</b>, <b>input_b</b>, <b>output</b>, <b>result</b>).  <b>input_a</b> and <b>input_b</b> are used to represent values being fed into the program.  <b>output</b> is where the final result of the program is placed before the program ends. <b>result</b> is updated with the result of mathmatical operations.<br/>
<hr/><br/>
A Computron program is made up of one or more commands, each on its own line. There are several commands available, the basic commands are:<br/><br/>
<b>copy</b> <i>&lt;source location&gt; &lt;destination location&gt;</i><br/><br/>
Copies the contents of location &lt;source&gt; to location &lt;destination&gt;<br/><br/>
Given the following state:<br/>
Triangle: 7<br/>
Square: 2<br/>
<br/>
And the following command: <code>copy triangle square</code><br/>
the result will be:<br/>
Triangle: 7<br/>
Square: 7<br/>
<br/>
All locations are valid as both sources and destinations.<br/><br/>

<b>copy</b> <i>&lt;value&gt; &lt;destination location&gt;</i><br/><br/>
Copies the literal value to the location.<br/>
Given the following state:<br/>
Triangle: 7<br/>
<br/>
And the following command: <code>copy 3 triangle</code><br/>
the result will be:<br/>
Triangle: 3<br/>
<br/>
<b>add</b><br/>
Adds the contents of triangle and square, placing the sum into result.<br/>
<br/>
<b>subtract</b><br/>
Subtracts the contents of square from the contents of triangle and places the difference into result.<br/>
<br/>
<b>multiply</b><br/>
Multiplies the contents of triangle and square, placing the product into result.<br/>
<br/>
<b>divide</b><br/>
Divides the contents of triangle by the contents of square, placing the quotient into result.<br/>
<br/>
<b>divide_full</b><br/>
Divides the contents of triangle by the contents of square, placing the quotient into result and the remainder into star.<br/>
<br/>
<b>compare</b> &lt;shape location&gt; &lt;shape location&gt;<br/>
Compares the contents of two shape locations.  The result is stored for use in a subsequent jump_if instruction.<br/>
<br/>
<b>:</b>&lt;label&gt;<br/>
Creates a label, which itself doesn't do anything. Labels are used as a reference point for jump commands. See the jump command for a usage example.<br/>
<br/>
<b>jump</b> &lt;label&gt;<br/>
Moves the control of the program to the label speciﬁed.<br/>
<br/>
<code>copy 1 triangle<br/>
copy triangle square<br/>
jump :A &lt;-- program is here<br/>
add<br/>
:A<br/>
<br/>
copy 1 triangle<br/>
copy triangle square<br/>
jump :A<br/>
add &lt;-- skipped<br/>
:A &lt;-- program is now here</code><br/>
<br/>
<b>jump_if_less</b> &lt;label&gt;<br/>
Moves control of the program to the label speciﬁed if the last compare resulted in the ﬁrst location being smaller than the second location.<br/>
<br/>
<b>jump_if_greater</b> &lt;label&gt;<br/>
Moves control of the program to the label speciﬁed if the last compare resulted in the ﬁrst location being larger than the second location.<br/>
<br/>
<b>jump_if_equal</b> &lt;label&gt;<br/>
Moves control of the program to the label speciﬁed if the last compare resulted in the ﬁrst location being equal to the second location.<br/>
<br/>
<b>alias</b> &lt;original_name&gt; &lt;new_name&gt;<br/>
Defines a new name for a location.  The original name can still be used interchangably with the new name.<br/>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>
Lines you wish the program to ignore can be prefaced with a #<br/><br/>
<code># This line will be ignored</code>
